A sleek, dark-mode personal wealth tracker built with React. Track bank balances, credit cards, crypto holdings (with real-time prices via CoinGecko), and portfolio income in one dashboard. LocalStorage persistence for offline useâ€”your MVP for financial clarity, starting as a hobby tool and scaling to family-shared subs.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Dashboard Overview**: Net worth pie charts, yearly income summaries, and asset allocations (banks, credits, stocks/ETFs, crypto).
- **Asset Management**: Add/edit/delete with simple formsâ€”date pickers for purchase dates and basic ROI calcs (annualized returns).
- **Crypto Tracking**: Input ticker + qty; auto-values from live CoinGecko prices (e.g., 0.5 BTC at $65K = $32.5K holding).
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Mint-inspired minimalist UI, default dark for late-night checks.
- **Persistence & Calcs**: LocalStorage saves your data; on-the-fly ROI (e.g., +15% annualized) and income aggregation.
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first for on-the-go family finance.

*Phase 1 MVPâ€”back-end (.NET APIs + Azure SQL) coming for auth, sharing, and real syncs.*
